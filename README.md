## Profile

[My hackerrank profile.](https://www.hackerrank.com/nonJedi)

## Purpose

Practice programming skills using the challenges on hackerrank.com. The
focus will be primarily on algorithms and skills that could be applied
in a data science position.

## Explanation

Each directory contains scripts or uncompiled programs to solve the
challenges located at
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/<folder_name>. Most solutions thus
far have been in Python3 as it's the language I'm most familiar with,
but I may expand to C++, R, lisp, haskell, or other languages as time
goes on.
